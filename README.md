# new-parents-evening

Analyse the feasablilty of using heuristics as a way to generate parents evening timetables.

There are many restrictions on the evening as a whole, suggesting that a linear optimisation method will not work, so before doing non-linear optimisation I tested heuristics.

The results ended up showing that roughly equivalent timetables will be produced statistically.
